### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Maciej Chrabaszcz, a dedicated PhD candidate at Warsaw University of Technology (WUT). My academic journey is deeply rooted in the field of exploratory model analysis, where I employ adversarial techniques and Explainable AI (XAI) methods to uncover new insights.

My doctoral research is centered on the strategic evaluation of AI Foundation Models through red teaming approaches, aiming to enhance their robustness and reliability.

Should you wish to discuss my research or have any inquiries, feel free to contact me at: maciej.chrabaszcz.dokt@pw.edu.pl
