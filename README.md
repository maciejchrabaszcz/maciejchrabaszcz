# Hi there ü§ó

I am Maciej Chrabaszcz, a PhD student at Warsaw University of Technology (WUT) and AI Safety engineer at NASK - National Research Institute. My research focuses on AI Safety, with a particular interest in developing efficient methods for enhancing model safety.

My research is centered on AI Safety, with a focus on efficient methods for increasing models safety. I am interested in methods that can efficiently improve model safety and detect when they behave abnormally.
